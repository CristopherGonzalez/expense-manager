\DoxyCodeLine{ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-\/1301 USA}
\DoxyCodeLine{ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies}
\DoxyCodeLine{ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Preamble}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your}
\DoxyCodeLine{freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public}
\DoxyCodeLine{License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free}
\DoxyCodeLine{software-\/to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This}
\DoxyCodeLine{General Public License applies to most of the Free Software}
\DoxyCodeLine{Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to}
\DoxyCodeLine{using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by}
\DoxyCodeLine{the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to}
\DoxyCodeLine{your programs, too.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not}
\DoxyCodeLine{price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you}
\DoxyCodeLine{have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for}
\DoxyCodeLine{this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it}
\DoxyCodeLine{if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it}
\DoxyCodeLine{in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid}
\DoxyCodeLine{anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.}
\DoxyCodeLine{These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether}
\DoxyCodeLine{gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that}
\DoxyCodeLine{you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the}
\DoxyCodeLine{source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their}
\DoxyCodeLine{rights.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and}
\DoxyCodeLine{(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribute and/or modify the software.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain}
\DoxyCodeLine{that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free}
\DoxyCodeLine{software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we}
\DoxyCodeLine{want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so}
\DoxyCodeLine{that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original}
\DoxyCodeLine{authors' reputations.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software}
\DoxyCodeLine{patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free}
\DoxyCodeLine{program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the}
\DoxyCodeLine{program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any}
\DoxyCodeLine{patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and}
\DoxyCodeLine{modification follow.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE}
\DoxyCodeLine{TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains}
\DoxyCodeLine{a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed}
\DoxyCodeLine{under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,}
\DoxyCodeLine{refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"}
\DoxyCodeLine{means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:}
\DoxyCodeLine{that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,}
\DoxyCodeLine{either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another}
\DoxyCodeLine{language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in}
\DoxyCodeLine{the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not}
\DoxyCodeLine{covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of}
\DoxyCodeLine{running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program}
\DoxyCodeLine{is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).}
\DoxyCodeLine{Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's}
\DoxyCodeLine{source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you}
\DoxyCodeLine{conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate}
\DoxyCodeLine{copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the}
\DoxyCodeLine{notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;}
\DoxyCodeLine{and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License}
\DoxyCodeLine{along with the Program.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and}
\DoxyCodeLine{you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion}
\DoxyCodeLine{of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1}
\DoxyCodeLine{above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices}
\DoxyCodeLine{    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in}
\DoxyCodeLine{    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any}
\DoxyCodeLine{    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third}
\DoxyCodeLine{    parties under the terms of this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively}
\DoxyCodeLine{    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such}
\DoxyCodeLine{    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an}
\DoxyCodeLine{    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a}
\DoxyCodeLine{    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide}
\DoxyCodeLine{    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under}
\DoxyCodeLine{    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this}
\DoxyCodeLine{    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but}
\DoxyCodeLine{    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on}
\DoxyCodeLine{    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If}
\DoxyCodeLine{identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,}
\DoxyCodeLine{and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in}
\DoxyCodeLine{themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those}
\DoxyCodeLine{sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based}
\DoxyCodeLine{on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of}
\DoxyCodeLine{this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the}
\DoxyCodeLine{entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest}
\DoxyCodeLine{your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to}
\DoxyCodeLine{exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or}
\DoxyCodeLine{collective works based on the Program.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program}
\DoxyCodeLine{with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of}
\DoxyCodeLine{a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under}
\DoxyCodeLine{the scope of this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,}
\DoxyCodeLine{under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of}
\DoxyCodeLine{Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-\/readable}
\DoxyCodeLine{    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections}
\DoxyCodeLine{    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three}
\DoxyCodeLine{    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your}
\DoxyCodeLine{    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete}
\DoxyCodeLine{    machine-\/readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be}
\DoxyCodeLine{    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium}
\DoxyCodeLine{    customarily used for software interchange; or,}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer}
\DoxyCodeLine{    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is}
\DoxyCodeLine{    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you}
\DoxyCodeLine{    received the program in object code or executable form with such}
\DoxyCodeLine{    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for}
\DoxyCodeLine{making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source}
\DoxyCodeLine{code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any}
\DoxyCodeLine{associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to}
\DoxyCodeLine{control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a}
\DoxyCodeLine{special exception, the source code distributed need not include}
\DoxyCodeLine{anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary}
\DoxyCodeLine{form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the}
\DoxyCodeLine{operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component}
\DoxyCodeLine{itself accompanies the executable.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering}
\DoxyCodeLine{access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent}
\DoxyCodeLine{access to copy the source code from the same place counts as}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not}
\DoxyCodeLine{compelled to copy the source along with the object code.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program}
\DoxyCodeLine{except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt}
\DoxyCodeLine{otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is}
\DoxyCodeLine{void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under}
\DoxyCodeLine{this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such}
\DoxyCodeLine{parties remain in full compliance.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not}
\DoxyCodeLine{signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are}
\DoxyCodeLine{prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by}
\DoxyCodeLine{modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and}
\DoxyCodeLine{all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying}
\DoxyCodeLine{the Program or works based on it.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the}
\DoxyCodeLine{original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to}
\DoxyCodeLine{these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further}
\DoxyCodeLine{restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.}
\DoxyCodeLine{You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to}
\DoxyCodeLine{this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent}
\DoxyCodeLine{infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),}
\DoxyCodeLine{conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or}
\DoxyCodeLine{otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not}
\DoxyCodeLine{excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this}
\DoxyCodeLine{License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you}
\DoxyCodeLine{may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent}
\DoxyCodeLine{license would not permit royalty-\/free redistribution of the Program by}
\DoxyCodeLine{all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then}
\DoxyCodeLine{the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to}
\DoxyCodeLine{refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under}
\DoxyCodeLine{any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to}
\DoxyCodeLine{apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other}
\DoxyCodeLine{circumstances.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any}
\DoxyCodeLine{patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any}
\DoxyCodeLine{such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the}
\DoxyCodeLine{integrity of the free software distribution system, which is}
\DoxyCodeLine{implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made}
\DoxyCodeLine{generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed}
\DoxyCodeLine{through that system in reliance on consistent application of that}
\DoxyCodeLine{system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing}
\DoxyCodeLine{to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot}
\DoxyCodeLine{impose that choice.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to}
\DoxyCodeLine{be a consequence of the rest of this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in}
\DoxyCodeLine{certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the}
\DoxyCodeLine{original copyright holder who places the Program under this License}
\DoxyCodeLine{may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding}
\DoxyCodeLine{those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among}
\DoxyCodeLine{countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates}
\DoxyCodeLine{the limitation as if written in the body of this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions}
\DoxyCodeLine{of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will}
\DoxyCodeLine{be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to}
\DoxyCodeLine{address new problems or concerns.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program}
\DoxyCodeLine{specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any}
\DoxyCodeLine{later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions}
\DoxyCodeLine{either of that version or of any later version published by the Free}
\DoxyCodeLine{Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of}
\DoxyCodeLine{this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software}
\DoxyCodeLine{Foundation.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free}
\DoxyCodeLine{programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author}
\DoxyCodeLine{to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free}
\DoxyCodeLine{Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes}
\DoxyCodeLine{make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals}
\DoxyCodeLine{of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and}
\DoxyCodeLine{of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{NO WARRANTY}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY}
\DoxyCodeLine{FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN}
\DoxyCodeLine{OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES}
\DoxyCodeLine{PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED}
\DoxyCodeLine{OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF}
\DoxyCodeLine{MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS}
\DoxyCodeLine{TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE}
\DoxyCodeLine{PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,}
\DoxyCodeLine{REPAIR OR CORRECTION.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING}
\DoxyCodeLine{WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR}
\DoxyCodeLine{REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,}
\DoxyCodeLine{INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING}
\DoxyCodeLine{OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED}
\DoxyCodeLine{TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY}
\DoxyCodeLine{YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER}
\DoxyCodeLine{PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE}
\DoxyCodeLine{POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}

\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts}
\DoxyCodeLine{ as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence}
\DoxyCodeLine{ the version number 2.1.]}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Preamble}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your}
\DoxyCodeLine{freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public}
\DoxyCodeLine{Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change}
\DoxyCodeLine{free software-\/to make sure the software is free for all its users.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some}
\DoxyCodeLine{specially designated software packages-\/typically libraries-\/of the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You}
\DoxyCodeLine{can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether}
\DoxyCodeLine{this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better}
\DoxyCodeLine{strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,}
\DoxyCodeLine{not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that}
\DoxyCodeLine{you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge}
\DoxyCodeLine{for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get}
\DoxyCodeLine{it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of}
\DoxyCodeLine{it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do}
\DoxyCodeLine{these things.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid}
\DoxyCodeLine{distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these}
\DoxyCodeLine{rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for}
\DoxyCodeLine{you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis}
\DoxyCodeLine{or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave}
\DoxyCodeLine{you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source}
\DoxyCodeLine{code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide}
\DoxyCodeLine{complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them}
\DoxyCodeLine{with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling}
\DoxyCodeLine{it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  We protect your rights with a two-\/step method: (1) we copyright the}
\DoxyCodeLine{library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal}
\DoxyCodeLine{permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that}
\DoxyCodeLine{there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is}
\DoxyCodeLine{modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know}
\DoxyCodeLine{that what they have is not the original version, so that the original}
\DoxyCodeLine{author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be}
\DoxyCodeLine{introduced by others.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of}
\DoxyCodeLine{any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot}
\DoxyCodeLine{effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a}
\DoxyCodeLine{restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that}
\DoxyCodeLine{any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be}
\DoxyCodeLine{consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the}
\DoxyCodeLine{ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser}
\DoxyCodeLine{General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and}
\DoxyCodeLine{is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use}
\DoxyCodeLine{this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those}
\DoxyCodeLine{libraries into non-\/free programs.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using}
\DoxyCodeLine{a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a}
\DoxyCodeLine{combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary}
\DoxyCodeLine{General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the}
\DoxyCodeLine{entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General}
\DoxyCodeLine{Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with}
\DoxyCodeLine{the library.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it}
\DoxyCodeLine{does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General}
\DoxyCodeLine{Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less}
\DoxyCodeLine{of an advantage over competing non-\/free programs.  These disadvantages}
\DoxyCodeLine{are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many}
\DoxyCodeLine{libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain}
\DoxyCodeLine{special circumstances.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to}
\DoxyCodeLine{encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes}
\DoxyCodeLine{a de-\/facto standard.  To achieve this, non-\/free programs must be}
\DoxyCodeLine{allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free}
\DoxyCodeLine{library does the same job as widely used non-\/free libraries.  In this}
\DoxyCodeLine{case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free}
\DoxyCodeLine{software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-\/free}
\DoxyCodeLine{programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of}
\DoxyCodeLine{free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in}
\DoxyCodeLine{non-\/free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU}
\DoxyCodeLine{operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating}
\DoxyCodeLine{system.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the}
\DoxyCodeLine{users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is}
\DoxyCodeLine{linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run}
\DoxyCodeLine{that program using a modified version of the Library.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and}
\DoxyCodeLine{modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a}
\DoxyCodeLine{"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The}
\DoxyCodeLine{former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must}
\DoxyCodeLine{be combined with the library in order to run.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE}
\DoxyCodeLine{TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other}
\DoxyCodeLine{program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or}
\DoxyCodeLine{other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of}
\DoxyCodeLine{this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").}
\DoxyCodeLine{Each licensee is addressed as "you".}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data}
\DoxyCodeLine{prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs}
\DoxyCodeLine{(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work}
\DoxyCodeLine{which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under}
\DoxyCodeLine{copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a}
\DoxyCodeLine{portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated}
\DoxyCodeLine{straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is}
\DoxyCodeLine{included without limitation in the term "modification".)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for}
\DoxyCodeLine{making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means}
\DoxyCodeLine{all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated}
\DoxyCodeLine{interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation}
\DoxyCodeLine{and installation of the library.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not}
\DoxyCodeLine{covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of}
\DoxyCodeLine{running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from}
\DoxyCodeLine{such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based}
\DoxyCodeLine{on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for}
\DoxyCodeLine{writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does}
\DoxyCodeLine{and what the program that uses the Library does.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's}
\DoxyCodeLine{complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that}
\DoxyCodeLine{you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an}
\DoxyCodeLine{appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact}
\DoxyCodeLine{all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any}
\DoxyCodeLine{warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Library.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,}
\DoxyCodeLine{and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a}
\DoxyCodeLine{fee.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion}
\DoxyCodeLine{of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1}
\DoxyCodeLine{above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices}
\DoxyCodeLine{    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no}
\DoxyCodeLine{    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a}
\DoxyCodeLine{    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses}
\DoxyCodeLine{    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility}
\DoxyCodeLine{    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,}
\DoxyCodeLine{    in the event an application does not supply such function or}
\DoxyCodeLine{    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of}
\DoxyCodeLine{    its purpose remains meaningful.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has}
\DoxyCodeLine{    a purpose that is entirely well-\/defined independent of the}
\DoxyCodeLine{    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any}
\DoxyCodeLine{    application-\/supplied function or table used by this function must}
\DoxyCodeLine{    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square}
\DoxyCodeLine{    root function must still compute square roots.)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If}
\DoxyCodeLine{identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,}
\DoxyCodeLine{and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in}
\DoxyCodeLine{themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those}
\DoxyCodeLine{sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based}
\DoxyCodeLine{on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of}
\DoxyCodeLine{this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the}
\DoxyCodeLine{entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote}
\DoxyCodeLine{it.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest}
\DoxyCodeLine{your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to}
\DoxyCodeLine{exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or}
\DoxyCodeLine{collective works based on the Library.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library}
\DoxyCodeLine{with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of}
\DoxyCodeLine{a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under}
\DoxyCodeLine{the scope of this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public}
\DoxyCodeLine{License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do}
\DoxyCodeLine{this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so}
\DoxyCodeLine{that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,}
\DoxyCodeLine{instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the}
\DoxyCodeLine{ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify}
\DoxyCodeLine{that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in}
\DoxyCodeLine{these notices.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for}
\DoxyCodeLine{that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all}
\DoxyCodeLine{subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of}
\DoxyCodeLine{the Library into a program that is not a library.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or}
\DoxyCodeLine{derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form}
\DoxyCodeLine{under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany}
\DoxyCodeLine{it with the complete corresponding machine-\/readable source code, which}
\DoxyCodeLine{must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a}
\DoxyCodeLine{medium customarily used for software interchange.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy}
\DoxyCodeLine{from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the}
\DoxyCodeLine{source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribute the source code, even though third parties are not}
\DoxyCodeLine{compelled to copy the source along with the object code.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or}
\DoxyCodeLine{linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a}
\DoxyCodeLine{work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and}
\DoxyCodeLine{therefore falls outside the scope of this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library}
\DoxyCodeLine{creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it}
\DoxyCodeLine{contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the}
\DoxyCodeLine{library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file}
\DoxyCodeLine{that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a}
\DoxyCodeLine{derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.}
\DoxyCodeLine{Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be}
\DoxyCodeLine{linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The}
\DoxyCodeLine{threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data}
\DoxyCodeLine{structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline}
\DoxyCodeLine{functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object}
\DoxyCodeLine{file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative}
\DoxyCodeLine{work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Library will still fall under Section 6.)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.}
\DoxyCodeLine{Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,}
\DoxyCodeLine{whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or}
\DoxyCodeLine{link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a}
\DoxyCodeLine{work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work}
\DoxyCodeLine{under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit}
\DoxyCodeLine{modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse}
\DoxyCodeLine{engineering for debugging such modifications.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by}
\DoxyCodeLine{this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work}
\DoxyCodeLine{during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the}
\DoxyCodeLine{copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference}
\DoxyCodeLine{directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one}
\DoxyCodeLine{of these things:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding}
\DoxyCodeLine{    machine-\/readable source code for the Library including whatever}
\DoxyCodeLine{    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under}
\DoxyCodeLine{    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked}
\DoxyCodeLine{    with the Library, with the complete machine-\/readable "work that}
\DoxyCodeLine{    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the}
\DoxyCodeLine{    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified}
\DoxyCodeLine{    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood}
\DoxyCodeLine{    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the}
\DoxyCodeLine{    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application}
\DoxyCodeLine{    to use the modified definitions.)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the}
\DoxyCodeLine{    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a}
\DoxyCodeLine{    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,}
\DoxyCodeLine{    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if}
\DoxyCodeLine{    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is}
\DoxyCodeLine{    interface-\/compatible with the version that the work was made with.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at}
\DoxyCodeLine{    least three years, to give the same user the materials}
\DoxyCodeLine{    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more}
\DoxyCodeLine{    than the cost of performing this distribution.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy}
\DoxyCodeLine{    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above}
\DoxyCodeLine{    specified materials from the same place.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these}
\DoxyCodeLine{    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for}
\DoxyCodeLine{reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,}
\DoxyCodeLine{the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is}
\DoxyCodeLine{normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major}
\DoxyCodeLine{components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on}
\DoxyCodeLine{which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies}
\DoxyCodeLine{the executable.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license}
\DoxyCodeLine{restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally}
\DoxyCodeLine{accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot}
\DoxyCodeLine{use both them and the Library together in an executable that you}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribute.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Library side-\/by-\/side in a single library together with other library}
\DoxyCodeLine{facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined}
\DoxyCodeLine{library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on}
\DoxyCodeLine{the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise}
\DoxyCodeLine{permitted, and provided that you do these two things:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work}
\DoxyCodeLine{    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library}
\DoxyCodeLine{    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the}
\DoxyCodeLine{    Sections above.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact}
\DoxyCodeLine{    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining}
\DoxyCodeLine{    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute}
\DoxyCodeLine{the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any}
\DoxyCodeLine{attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your}
\DoxyCodeLine{rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,}
\DoxyCodeLine{or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses}
\DoxyCodeLine{terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not}
\DoxyCodeLine{signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are}
\DoxyCodeLine{prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by}
\DoxyCodeLine{modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and}
\DoxyCodeLine{all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying}
\DoxyCodeLine{the Library or works based on it.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the}
\DoxyCodeLine{Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the}
\DoxyCodeLine{original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library}
\DoxyCodeLine{subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further}
\DoxyCodeLine{restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.}
\DoxyCodeLine{You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with}
\DoxyCodeLine{this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent}
\DoxyCodeLine{infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),}
\DoxyCodeLine{conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or}
\DoxyCodeLine{otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not}
\DoxyCodeLine{excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot}
\DoxyCodeLine{distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this}
\DoxyCodeLine{License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you}
\DoxyCodeLine{may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent}
\DoxyCodeLine{license would not permit royalty-\/free redistribution of the Library by}
\DoxyCodeLine{all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then}
\DoxyCodeLine{the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to}
\DoxyCodeLine{refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any}
\DoxyCodeLine{particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,}
\DoxyCodeLine{and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any}
\DoxyCodeLine{patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any}
\DoxyCodeLine{such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the}
\DoxyCodeLine{integrity of the free software distribution system which is}
\DoxyCodeLine{implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made}
\DoxyCodeLine{generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed}
\DoxyCodeLine{through that system in reliance on consistent application of that}
\DoxyCodeLine{system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing}
\DoxyCodeLine{to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot}
\DoxyCodeLine{impose that choice.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to}
\DoxyCodeLine{be a consequence of the rest of this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in}
\DoxyCodeLine{certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the}
\DoxyCodeLine{original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add}
\DoxyCodeLine{an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,}
\DoxyCodeLine{so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus}
\DoxyCodeLine{excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if}
\DoxyCodeLine{written in the body of this License.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new}
\DoxyCodeLine{versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.}
\DoxyCodeLine{Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,}
\DoxyCodeLine{but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library}
\DoxyCodeLine{specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and}
\DoxyCodeLine{"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and}
\DoxyCodeLine{conditions either of that version or of any later version published by}
\DoxyCodeLine{the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a}
\DoxyCodeLine{license version number, you may choose any version ever published by}
\DoxyCodeLine{the Free Software Foundation.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free}
\DoxyCodeLine{programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,}
\DoxyCodeLine{write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is}
\DoxyCodeLine{copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free}
\DoxyCodeLine{Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our}
\DoxyCodeLine{decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status}
\DoxyCodeLine{of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing}
\DoxyCodeLine{and reuse of software generally.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{NO WARRANTY}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO}
\DoxyCodeLine{WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.}
\DoxyCodeLine{EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR}
\DoxyCodeLine{OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY}
\DoxyCodeLine{KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE}
\DoxyCodeLine{IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR}
\DoxyCodeLine{PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE}
\DoxyCodeLine{LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME}
\DoxyCodeLine{THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN}
\DoxyCodeLine{WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY}
\DoxyCodeLine{AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU}
\DoxyCodeLine{FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR}
\DoxyCodeLine{CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE}
\DoxyCodeLine{LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING}
\DoxyCodeLine{RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A}
\DoxyCodeLine{FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF}
\DoxyCodeLine{SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH}
\DoxyCodeLine{DAMAGES.}
